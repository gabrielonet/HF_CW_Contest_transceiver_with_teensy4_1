<li>This would be my second home made HF transceiver.
<li>I/Q quadrature + 9 mhz crystal filter I.F. stage
<li>H-mode RF mixer
<li>Si5351 VFO but heavy filtered for each band, TX and RX (more than 60 dB second harmonic rejection)
<li>Teensy controller for logic
<li>Teensy + audio shield as Hilbert DSP for LSB / USB rejection
