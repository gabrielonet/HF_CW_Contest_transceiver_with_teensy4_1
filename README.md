This would be my second home made HF transceiver.
I/Q quadrature + 9 mhz crystal filter I.F. stage
H-mode RF mixer
Si5351 VFO but heavy filtered for each band, TX and RX (more than 60 dB second harmonic rejection)
Teensy controller for logic
Teensy + audio shield as Hilbert DSP for LSB / USB rejection
